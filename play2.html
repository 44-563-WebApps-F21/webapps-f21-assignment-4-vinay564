    <h6 class="marchmont" >LORD CAVERSHAM. </h6> [_Smiling_.] <p class="speech marchmont" >  I don’t think Lord Goring has arrived yet.</p>

    <h6 class="basildon" >MABEL CHILTERN. </h6> [_Coming up to_ LORD CAVERSHAM.] <p class="speech basildon"> Why do you call Lord
    Goring good-for-nothing?</p>
    
    [MABEL CHILTERN _is a perfect example of the English type of prettiness_,
    _the apple-blossom type_.  _She has all the fragrance and freedom of a
    flower_.  _There is ripple after ripple of sunlight in her hair_, _and
    the little mouth_, _with its parted lips_, _is expectant_, _like the
    mouth of a child_.  _She has the fascinating tyranny of youth_, _and the
    astonishing courage of innocence_.  _To sane people she is not
    reminiscent of any work of art_.  _But she is really like a Tanagra
    statuette_, _and would be rather annoyed if she were told so_.]
    
    <h6 class="marchmont">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6> <p class="speech marchmont"> Because he leads such an idle life.</p>
    
    <h6 class="basildon" >MABEL CHILTERN.</h6> <p class="speech basildon"> How can you say such a thing?  Why, he rides in the Row
    at ten o’clock in the morning, goes to the Opera three times a week,
    changes his clothes at least five times a day, and dines out every night
    of the season.  You don’t call that leading an idle life, do you?</p>
    
    <h6 class="marchmont">LORD CAVERSHAM.</h6> [_Looking at her with a kindly twinkle in his eyes_.]
    <p class="speech marchmont">You are a very charming young lady!</p>

    
<h6 class="basildon">MABEL CHILTERN.</h6> <p class="speech basildon"> How sweet of you to say that, Lord Caversham!  Do come
to us more often.  You know we are always at home on Wednesdays, and you
look so well with your star!</p>
