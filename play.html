    <h4>AN IDEAL HUSBAND</h4>
    
    
    <h5>_The room is brilliantly lighted and full of guests_.  _At the top of
        the staircase stands_ LADY CHILTERN, _a woman of grave Greek beauty_,
        _about twenty-seven years of age_.  _She receives the guests as they come
        up_.  _Over the well of the staircase hangs a great chandelier with wax
        lights_, _which illumine a large eighteenth-century French
        tapestry—representing the Triumph of Love_, _from a design by
        Boucher—that is stretched on the staircase wall_.  _On the right is the
        entrance to the music-room_.  _The sound of a string quartette is faintly
        heard_.  _The entrance on the left leads to other reception-rooms_.  MRS.
        MARCHMONT _and_ LADY BASILDON, _two very pretty women_, _are seated
        together on a Louis Seize sofa_.  _They are types of exquisite
        fragility_.  _Their affectation of manner has a delicate charm_.
        _Watteau would have loved to paint them_.

       <h6 class="marchmont"> MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>  Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?<br>

       <h6 class="basildon"> LADY BASILDON. </h6> I suppose so.  Are you?<br>

       <h6 class="marchmont"> MRS. MARCHMONT.  </h6> Yes.  Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?<br>

       <h6 class="basildon">LADY BASILDON.  </h6>Horribly tedious!  Never know why I go.  Never know why I go anywhere.<br>

       <h6 class="marchmont">  MRS. MARCHMONT.  </h6>I come here to be educated.<br>

       <h6 class="basildon"> LADY BASILDON.  </h6> Ah! I hate being educated!<br>

       <h6 class="marchmont"> MRS. MARCHMONT. </h6> So do I.  It puts one almost on a level with the
        commercial classes, doesn’t it?  But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always
        telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life.  So I come
        here to try to find one.<br>

        <h6 class="basildon"> LADY BASILDON. </h6> [_Looking round through her lorgnette_.]  I don’t see
        anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
        The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole
        time.<br>

        <h6 class="marchmont">  MRS. MARCHMONT. </h6> How very trivial of him!<br>

        <h6 class="basildon"> LADY BASILDON. </h6> Terribly trivial!  What did your man talk about?<br>

        <h6 class="marchmont">  MRS. MARCHMONT.</h6>  About myself.<br>

        <h6 class="basildon">LADY BASILDON.</h6>  [_Languidly_.]  And were you interested?<br>

        <h6 class="marchmont"> MRS. MARCHMONT. </h6> [_Shaking her head_.]  Not in the smallest degree.<br>

        <h6 class="basildon"> LADY BASILDON. </h6> What martyrs we are, dear Margaret!<br>

        <h6 class="marchmont"> MRS. MARCHMONT. </h6> [_Rising_.]  And how well it becomes us, Olivia!<br>

        [_They rise and go towards the music-room_.  _The_ VICOMTE DE NANJAC, _a
        young attaché known for his neckties and his Anglomania_, _approaches
        with a low bow_, _and enters into conversation_.]<br>

        MASON.  [_Announcing guests from the top of the staircase_.]  Mr. and
        Lady Jane Barford.  Lord Caversham.<br>

        [_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM, _an old gentleman of seventy_, _wearing the
        riband and star of the Garter_.  _A fine Whig type_.  _Rather like a
        portrait by Lawrence_.]<br>

        LORD CAVERSHAM.  Good evening, Lady Chiltern!  Has my good-for-nothing
        young son been here?<br>
